# Custom Comparator

👨‍💼 We've improved things so the `ListItem` components don't rerender when there
are unrelated changes, but what if there are changes to the list item state?

Hover over one of the list items and notice they all rerender. But we really
only need the hovered item to rerender (as well as the one that's no longer
highlighted).

So let's add a custom comparator to the `memo` call in `ListItem` to only
rerender when the changed props will affect the output.

Here's an example of the comparator:

```tsx
const Avatar = memo(
	function Avatar({ user }: { user: User }) {
		return <img src={user.avatarUrl} alt={user.name} />
	},
	(prevProps, nextProps) => {
		const avatarChanged = prevProps.user.avatarUrl !== nextProps.user.avatarUrl
		const nameChanged = prevProps.user.name !== nextProps.user.name
		return avatarChanged || nameChanged
	},
)
```

So even if the user object changes, the `Avatar` component will only rerender if
the `avatarUrl` or `name` properties change.

By default, React just checks the reference of the props, so by providing a
custom comparator, we override that default behavior to have a more fine-grained
control over when the component should rerender.

So let's add a custom comparator to the `ListItem` component so it only rerenders
when absolutely necessary.

Pull up the React Profiler and the DevTools Performance tab to see the impact
of this optimization as you hover over different list items.
